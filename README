This repository holds plugins I've written for PyBlosxom over the
years.  Some of them are exercises and some of them are ones I use on
my blog.

.. Note::

   I've just moved this from an svn repository that I was ignoring to
   a git repository and then pushed it to github.  As such, it's got a
   lot of bitrot, but hopefully this puts it in a position to get better.

Questions, comments, or concerns: email me at willg at bluesock dot org.
